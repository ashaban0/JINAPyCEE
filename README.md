Public <a href="http://www.jinaweb.org/">JINA</a> Python Chemical Evolution Environment 

This repository contains a series of multi-zone galactic chemical evolution codes written in Python 3. It represents an extension of the <a href="http://github.com/NuGrid/NuPyCEE">NuPyCEE</a> package (see also our <a href="http://nugrid.github.io/NuPyCEE/">website</a>) and the end point of the <a href="http://www.jinaweb.org/">JINA</a>-<a href="http://www.nugridstars.org/">NuGrid</a> chemical evolution pipeline (see <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017nuco.confb0203C">Côté et al. 2017a</a>).

**OMEGA+** (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...859...67C">Côté et al. 2018</a>)

- 2-zone model including a galactic (star-forming gas) and circumgalactic (hot gas reservoir) components.
- Star formation based on the balance between gas inflows and stellar feedback.
- Chemical evolution of the galactic component calculated by OMEGA (One-zone Model for the Evolution of GAlaxies, <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...835..128C">Côté et al. 2017b</a>), a code part of <a href="http://github.com/NuGrid/NuPyCEE">NuPyCEE</a>.

**GAMMA** (Galaxy Assembly with Merger-trees for Modeling Abundances, <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...859...67C">Côté et al. 2018</a>)

- Semi-analytic code following the mass assembly of galaxies based on merger trees provided by cosmological simulations.
- Evolution of each building-block galaxy (each branch of the merger tree) calculated by OMEGA+, a code part of JINAPyCEE.
- Please see the  <a href="https://github.com/caterpillarproject/caga">caga</a> open-source analysis codes to use GAMMA on top of <a href="http://www.caterpillarproject.org/">Caterpillar</a> merger trees (see <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...818...10G">Griffen et al. 2016</a>).


**Requirement**

* <a href="http://github.com/NuGrid/NuPyCEE">NuPyCEE</a> to access the chemical evolution functions.
* <a href="https://ytree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">ytree</a> if you want to read consistent-tree files for GAMMA.

**Userguides**: See the <a href="https://github.com/becot85/JINAPyCEE/tree/master/DOC">DOC</a> directory.

### Installation Instructions

* Go in the directory with a terminal **where the NuPyCEE directory is located** (not in the NuPyCEE directory itself).
* Clone the GitHub repository:
	* `git clone https://github.com/becot85/JINAPyCEE.git`
* From the same directory which contains the cloned NuPyCEE and JINAPyCEE directories, you can import the codes in Python mode by typing:
	* `from JINAPyCEE import omega_plus`
	* `from JINAPyCEE import gamma`
